# Frappe Investing -- site initializer
# =============================================================================
#
# One serialized deployment step that installs/migrates frappe_investing
# on ONE already-existing site, then repairs its static assets. It is meant
# to run once per environment as its own job/service (e.g. in place of a
# generic `bench --site all migrate` migration-service command), never as
# part of every web/worker container start.
#
# Hard boundaries, enforced below, not just documented:
#   - Never creates or drops a site. SITE_NAME must name a site that already
#     exists (its sites/<site>/site_config.json is read, never written by
#     this script beyond bench's own `set-config allow_tests`). On a fresh
#     deploy the orchestrator's create-site service may still be running when
#     this job starts, so existence is awaited with a bounded poll -- never
#     forced by creating the site here.
#   - Never reads or prints a database/admin password, API key or other
#     secret. Only bench subcommands that operate against the site's own
#     already-configured site_config.json are used; none of them are ever
#     called with a credential on the command line.
#   - Every bench invocation reads stdin from /dev/null, so nothing here can
#     block on an interactive prompt.
#   - Never calls `bench execute` / relies on `frappe.get_attr` against
#     frappe_investing. That CLI helper refuses to resolve a dotted path
#     belonging to an app that is not yet installed on the target site, so a
#     custom-function call issued before `install-app` succeeds would simply
#     fail with that restriction. Every step here is a plain, native bench
#     subcommand (list-apps / install-app / migrate / set-config / run-tests
#     / build) instead.
#   - Idempotent: safe to run again against a site that is already fully
#     installed/migrated/built. Nothing here assumes a first run.
#
# Required:
#   SITE_NAME                    Explicit target site. No default, and never
#                                 "all" -- this script always names exactly
#                                 one site.
#
# Optional:
#   BENCH_DIR                    Bench root. Default: /home/frappe/frappe-bench
#   INVESTING_ALLOW_TESTS     Set to exactly "1" to turn the site's
#                                 allow_tests config flag on. Any other value
#                                 (including unset) leaves allow_tests alone
#                                 in either direction -- this script never
#                                 disables an operator-set flag either.
#   INVESTING_RUN_TESTS       Set to exactly "1" (together with
#                                 INVESTING_ALLOW_TESTS=1) to additionally
#                                 run the real integration suite via
#                                 `bench run-tests`. Optional; skipped by
#                                 default.
#   INVESTING_INIT_RESULT_PATH
#                                 Where to write the safe JSON result file.
#                                 Default:
#                                 <BENCH_DIR>/sites/investing-staging-result.json
#   INVESTING_SITE_WAIT_TIMEOUT
#                                 Bound (in seconds) on how long the
#                                 wait-for-site guard below polls for the site
#                                 to appear and answer before failing.
#                                 Default: 780 (13 minutes).
#   INVESTING_SITE_WAIT_INTERVAL
#                                 Seconds between readiness polls. Default: 5
#
# Usage:
